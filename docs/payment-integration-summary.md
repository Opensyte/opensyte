# Payment Integration Service - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the Payment Integration Service (Task 5) for the Agency Workflow Platform. The service integrates Stripe payment processing with the invoice workflow, enabling automated payment link generation, webhook handling, and invoice status updates.

## Components Implemented

### 1. PaymentService Class (`src/lib/services/payment-service.ts`)

A comprehensive service class that handles all Stripe payment operations:

**Key Methods:**

- `createPaymentLink(invoice)` - Generates Stripe checkout session and payment link
- `handleWebhook(payload)` - Processes Stripe webhook events
- `markInvoiceAsPaid(invoiceId, paymentDetails)` - Updates invoice and creates payment record
- `recordPartialPayment(invoiceId, amount)` - Handles partial payments
- `verifyWebhookSignature(payload, signature, secret)` - Validates webhook authenticity

**Features:**

- Automatic Stripe customer creation/reuse
- Checkout session with invoice metadata
- Support for full and partial payments
- Webhook event handling (checkout.session.completed, payment_intent.succeeded, payment_intent.payment_failed)
- Transaction-based payment recording
- Error handling and logging

### 2. Payment API Router (`src/server/api/routers/payment.ts`)

tRPC router providing payment-related API endpoints:

**Procedures:**

- `createPaymentLink` - Generate payment link for an invoice
- `getPaymentLink` - Retrieve existing payment link
- `recordManualPayment` - Record non-Stripe payments (cash, check, etc.)
- `getPaymentHistory` - View all payments for an invoice
- `refundPayment` - Process full or partial refunds

**Security:**

- Organization-level access control
- Permission validation
- Invoice ownership verification

### 3. Stripe Webhook Endpoint (`src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`)

Next.js API route for receiving Stripe webhooks:

**Features:**

- Webhook signature verification
- Event routing to PaymentService
- Error handling and logging
- Secure webhook processing

### 4. Invoice Integration

Updated invoice workflow to include payment processing:

**Changes to `src/server/api/routers/finance/invoice.ts`:**

- Automatic payment link generation when invoice is sent
- Payment URL included in invoice emails
- Graceful fallback if payment link generation fails

**Changes to `src/server/email/templates/invoice-email.tsx`:**

- Added payment button with Stripe checkout link
- Conditional rendering based on payment URL availability
- User-friendly payment instructions

### 5. Environment Configuration

**Added to `src/env.js`:**

- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Stripe API secret key (required)
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Webhook signing secret (optional)

**Added to `.env`:**

```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key_here
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here
```

### 6. Database Schema

The Invoice model already includes Stripe fields (from previous tasks):

- `stripeSessionId` - Checkout session ID
- `stripePaymentUrl` - Payment link URL
- `stripeCustomerId` - Stripe customer ID
- `paymentIntentId` - Payment intent ID

## Testing

Comprehensive test coverage across three test files:

### Payment Service Tests (`src/lib/__tests__/payment-service.test.ts`)

- 16 tests covering type interfaces, status logic, amount conversion, webhook events, and signature verification

### Payment Router Tests (`src/server/api/routers/__tests__/payment.test.ts`)

- 19 tests covering input validation, payment methods, refund logic, and error handling

### Invoice Payment Integration Tests (`src/lib/__tests__/invoice-payment-integration.test.ts`)

- 18 tests covering end-to-end invoice payment flow, webhook processing, email integration, and lifecycle management

**Total: 53 tests, all passing**

## Workflow Integration

The payment service integrates seamlessly with the invoice lifecycle:

1. **Invoice Creation** - Invoice created in DRAFT status without payment link
2. **Invoice Sending** - Payment link automatically generated and included in email
3. **Customer Payment** - Customer clicks link and pays via Stripe
4. **Webhook Processing** - Stripe sends webhook to `/api/webhooks/stripe`
5. **Status Update** - Invoice status updated to PAID, payment record created
6. **Confirmation** - Customer receives payment confirmation

## Key Features

### Automatic Payment Processing

- Payment links generated automatically when invoices are sent
- No manual intervention required
- Stripe customer records created and reused

### Webhook Handling

- Secure signature verification
- Support for multiple event types
- Automatic invoice status updates
- Payment record creation

### Flexible Payment Options

- Online payments via Stripe
- Manual payment recording for offline payments
- Support for partial payments
- Full and partial refunds

### Error Resilience

- Graceful degradation if payment link fails
- Invoice still sent even if Stripe is unavailable
- Comprehensive error logging
- Transaction-based updates for data consistency

## Security Considerations

1. **Webhook Verification** - All webhooks verified using Stripe signature
2. **Organization Isolation** - All operations scoped to organization
3. **Permission Checks** - Finance permissions required for all operations
4. **Secure Credentials** - API keys stored in environment variables
5. **PCI Compliance** - No credit card data stored locally

## Usage Example

### Creating and Sending an Invoice with Payment Link

```typescript
// 1. Create invoice (existing functionality)
const invoice = await trpc.invoice.createInvoice.mutate({
  organizationId: "org_123",
  customerId: "cust_123",
  items: [{ description: "Service", quantity: 1, unitPrice: 100 }],
  // ... other fields
});

// 2. Send invoice (automatically generates payment link)
await trpc.invoice.sendInvoice.mutate({
  id: invoice.id,
  organizationId: "org_123",
});

// 3. Customer receives email with payment button
// 4. Customer clicks button and pays
// 5. Webhook automatically updates invoice to PAID
```

### Recording Manual Payment

```typescript
await trpc.payment.recordManualPayment.mutate({
  invoiceId: "inv_123",
  amount: 100,
  paymentMethod: "BANK_TRANSFER",
  reference: "REF-12345",
  paymentDate: new Date(),
  notes: "Wire transfer received",
});
```

### Processing Refund

```typescript
await trpc.payment.refundPayment.mutate({
  paymentId: "pay_123",
  amount: 50, // Partial refund
  reason: "Customer requested partial refund",
});
```

## Dependencies Added

- `stripe` (v19.0.0) - Official Stripe Node.js SDK

## Next Steps

To complete the payment integration:

1. **Configure Stripe Account**

   - Create Stripe account at https://stripe.com
   - Get API keys from dashboard
   - Add keys to `.env` file

2. **Set Up Webhook Endpoint**

   - Add webhook endpoint in Stripe dashboard: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
   - Select events: `checkout.session.completed`, `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`
   - Copy webhook signing secret to `.env`

3. **Test Payment Flow**

   - Create test invoice
   - Send invoice to test email
   - Use Stripe test card (4242 4242 4242 4242)
   - Verify webhook processing and status update

4. **Production Deployment**
   - Replace test API keys with live keys
   - Update webhook endpoint to production URL
   - Test with real payment (small amount)
   - Monitor webhook logs
